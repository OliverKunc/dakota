For weighted multilevel Monte Carlo, model graph selection options become available

Description::
Referring to :dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate-acv_recursive_diff`,
weighted MLMC is a special case of ACV-RD, resulting in a forward to
the generalized ACV solver for the case of a fixed hierarchical DAG.

While the DAG is fixed, other search options in generalized
ACV become available -- see
:dakkw:`method-multilevel_sampling-weighted-search_model_graphs-model_selection`.
