Ordering of the points of this rank-1 lattice

Description::
Specify the order in which the points of this rank-1 lattice should be returned. 
Currently, Dakota supports :dakkw:`natural` and :dakkw:`radical_inverse` ordering. 
The default behavior is to return points using radical inverse ordering, i.e., 
the points will be generated according to


.. math:: \boldsymbol{t}_n = \left\{ \phi_b(n) \boldsymbol{z} \right}

where :math:`\phi_b(n)` denotes the so-called *radical inverse* function in base :math:`b` (usually, and in Dakota, :math:`b = 2`). 
This function transforms a number :math:`x = (\hdots, x_2x_1)_b` in its base-:math:`b` representation 
to :math:`\phi_b(x) = (0.x_1x_2\hdots)_b`. Note that the above expression agrees with original 
formulation when :math:`N = b^m` for any :math:`m \geq 0`. The advantage of the latter formulation is that one can 
generate an arbitrary number of points :math:`N`, effectively turning the lattice *rule* into a lattice *sequence*.

When the :dakkw:`natural` ordering of the points is used, it is implicitly assumed that the user will 
only request a number of points that is a power of 2. Failing to do so will result in a set of points 
for which one or more dimensions are not uniformly covered, resulting in bad low-discrepancy properties, 
and ultimately bad performance of the method that uses these points. It is recommended to not use this option unless you know what you're doing.
