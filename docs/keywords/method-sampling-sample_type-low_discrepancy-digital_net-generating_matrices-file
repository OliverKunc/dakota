Specify generating matrices read from file

Description::
The generating matrices will be read from an external file. 
The file format is

Generating matrices should be provided as a matrix of integers. 
The number of rows in the matrix determines the maximum dimension of the lattice rule.
The number of columns in the matrix determines the ``log2`` of the maximum number of points.
An integer at the :math:`j`th row and :math:`m`th column encodes the :math:`m`th column of the :math:`j`th generating matrix :math:`C_j`. 
Since the :math:`m`th column of :math:`C_j` is a collection of 0's and 1's, it can be represented as an integer with :math:`t` bits, where 
:math:`t` is the number of rows in the :math:`j`th generating matrix :math:`C_j`. 
By default, the encoding assumes the integers are stored with *least significant bit first* (see :dakkw:`integer_format`), so that the first integer in the :math:`j`th row is 1.

When this keyword is specified, the user must also specify the ``log2`` of the maximum number of points in the lattice using the keyword :dakkw:`m_max`, 
and the bit depth (the number of bits in the integers that encode a column of the generating matrix, or the number of rows in the generating matrices) using the keyword :dakkw:`t_max`.
