Do not scramble this digital net

Description::
The digital net should preserve the structure of the points after randomization. 
This can be achieved by *scrambling* the digital net. Scrambling can also improve the rate of convergence 
of a method that uses these scrambled points to compute the mean of the model response. 
Owen's scrambling :cite:p:`Owen98` is the most well-known scrambling technique. A particular variant 
is linear matrix scrambling, which is implemented in Dakota :cite:p`Matouvsek98`.
In linear matrix scrambling, we left-multiply each generating matrix with a lower-triangular random scramble matrix. 
The number of rows in the scramble matrix can be set with the keyword :dakkw:`t_scramble`.

When this keyword is provided, the digital net points will not be scrambled. 
Unscrambled digital net points have generally less performance compared to their scrambled counterparts, so it is highly recommended to 
not use this keyword, unless you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing.
