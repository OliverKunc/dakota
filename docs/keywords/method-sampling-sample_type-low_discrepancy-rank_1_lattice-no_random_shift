Do not shift this rank-1 lattice

Description::
By default, the lattice points will be shifted using a random shift vector.
This means that the points will be generated according to


.. math:: \boldsymbol{t}_n = \left\{ \frac{n \boldsymbol{z}}{N} + \Delta \right}

where :math:`\Delta` is a vector with standard uniform random points. 
When this keyword is specified, the lattice points will **not** be shifted. 
This means that the same set of lattice points will be generated, irrespective 
of the value of the random seed. The first, untransformed, point in the sequence will always be 
:math:`\boldsymbol{t}_0 = (0, 0, \ldots, 0)`.
