Blurb::
Perform a recursion of admissible model subsets for a given model ensemble

Description::
This option specifies an enumerative search over all model subsets
for a given model ensemble.  In the MFMC case, there is a single DAG
definition per model subset.  Thus the model subset search is not
combined with a DAG search for MFMC.  The model subset with the best
performance (lowest estimator variance for a prescribed budget or lowest
cost for a prescribed accuracy) is selected for final post-processing.
