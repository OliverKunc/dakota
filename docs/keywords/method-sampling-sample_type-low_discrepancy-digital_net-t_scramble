Number of rows in the affine scramble matrices

Description::
Use this option to set the number of rows in the linear scramble matrices.
A linear scrambling matrix is a lower-tridiagonal matrix with shape
``t_scramble x t_max``, i.e.,

.. code-block::

    1 0 0 0 0
    x 1 0 0 0
    x x 1 0 0
    x x x 1 0
    x x x x 1

which is encoded as a vector of length ``t_max``` with integer entries 
with ``t_scramble`` bits each encoding the columnds of the scramble matrix (analogous to the way generating matrices are stored).
The value of ``t_scramble`` must be less than or equal to :dakkw:`t_max`.
Note that this option has no effect if the keyword :dakkw:`no_scrambling` is specified.
