Blurb::
The multilevel best linear unbiased estimator (ML BLUE) sampling approach

Description::
An adaptive multifidelity sampling method that improves accuracy
and/or efficiency through variance reduction relative to
single-fidelity Monte Carlo sampling.  It employs an ensemble model to
manage a set of lower-fidelity approximations to a single truth model.

Compared to other estimators (MLMC, MLCV MC, MFMC, ACV, generalized
ACV), ML BLUE employs a group-based approach, where independent
samples are allocated for each group and each group is composed of
combinations of models.

**Status**

This method is under actove development.  While currently exhibiting
good performance for a small number of models (5 or less), larger
model ensembles result in ill-conditioning. Throttling can delay these
problems in some cases, but more advanced numerical treatments are
needed (in progress).

*Default Behavior*

The ``multilevel_blue`` method employs Monte Carlo sample
sets by default, but this default can be overridden to use Latin
hypercube sample sets using ``sample_type`` ``lhs``.  Allocations
remain governed by Monte Carlo variance for all cases.

*Expected Output*

The ``multilevel_blue`` method reports estimates of the first four
moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for each group and
for each model instance.  The method does not support any level
mappings (response, probability, reliability, generalized reliability)
at this time.

*Usage Tips*

The ``multilevel_blue`` method must be used in combination with an
ensemble model specification that enumerates a truth model and
approximation models using either a model form sequence, a
discretization level sequence, or some combination.  For each model
form and discretization, each instance must either provide a
``solution_level_cost`` or return metadata for estimating cost.  For a
sequence of discretization levels, ``solution_level_control`` must
identify the variable string descriptor that controls the resolution
levels and the associated array of relative costs must be provided
using ``solution_level_cost``.

Topics::

Examples::
The following method block:

.. code-block::

    method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
	multilevel_blue
	  solution_mode online_pilot
	    relaxation factor_sequence = .5 .75 1.
	  pilot_samples = 25  #independent
	  seed = 8674132
	  max_function_evaluations = 500

specifies ML BLUE using an iterated online pilot in
combination with the default allcoation solver (global_local),
the default shared pilot estimation of group covariances,
and and ensemble model identified by the HIERARCH pointer.

This HIERARCH model specification provides a one-dimensional sequence,
here defined by a set of discretization levels:

.. code-block::

    model,
	id_model = 'HIERARCH'
	variables_pointer = 'HF_VARS'
	surrogate ensemble
	  truth_model = 'HF'

    model,
	id_model = 'HF'
	variables_pointer = 'HF_VARS'
	interface_pointer = 'HF_INT'
	simulation
	  solution_level_control = 'mesh_size'
	  solution_level_cost = 1 16 256
